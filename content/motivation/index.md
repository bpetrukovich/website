I believe anyone involved with the web has had, or still has, the idea of creating their own personal website. These thoughts have crossed my mind time and again since childhood.

And here it is.

The site runs on an amazingly simple and fast stack: the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator and the beautiful, functional [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme. But technology changes. Recalling Plato, one could say this is the _"world of things."_

Far more important is the _"world of ideas"_ — the principles laid down at the project's very inception:

1. **Reflection of Self:** To show who I am.
2. **Authorship:** To express my opinion.
3. **Contacts:** To contain all my up-to-date ways to connect.
4. **Minimalism:** A simple, clean, and timeless design.
5. **Performance:** High-speed operation.
6. **Clarity:** Understandable structure and content.
7. **Accessibility:** To work for everyone, from anywhere.
8. **Visibility:** To be optimized for search (SEO).
9. **Relevance:** To be regularly updated.
